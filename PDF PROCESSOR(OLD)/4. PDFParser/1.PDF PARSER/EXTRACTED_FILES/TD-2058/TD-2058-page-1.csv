OVERVIEW
"Windows NT, the operating system MCL Tool uses, coordinates the functions performed by the microprocessor to allow true multi-tasking.  You can be working in a spreadsheet, writing a letter in a word processor, and using MCL Tool to interface with your building all at the same time.  This is an overview of computer basics with information on the use of Windows NT. Refer to your Windows NT manuals for more information."

"NOTE:  If you are unfamiliar with Windows NT operations, please see the Windows NT Help"
section in this chapter.
"The main difference between Windows NT and DOS is multi-tasking. Multi-tasking describes an operating system that can perform more than one task at a time. With MCL Tool, multi-tasking is important because it guarantees that alarms and other critical operations are always given proper attention."

KEYBOARD There are six types of keys on the keyboard:
"Standard keys - These are the keys that correspond to typewriter keys (a, b, 1, 2, SHIFT, TAB, RETURN, etc.)."
Use the standard keys to enter and edit text.
"Cursor keys - These are the keys to the right of the standard keys. The four arrow keys (Left, Right, Up,"
"and Down) and the six page keys (Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, and Page Down) are included in this group."
"Keypad keys - These are the keys that correspond to the regular calculator functions (1, 2, 3, +, *, ENTER,"
etc.) and are located on the right side of the keyboard.
Function keys - These are special keys located at the top of your keyboard that can be custom defined by applications. Some applications provide an overlay sheet to remind you of the function key assign- ments.   MCL Tool has several function keys.
Modifier keys - These are special keys that are used to alter the operation of other keys. The most com-
monly used are the CTRL (Control) and ALT (Alternate) keys. They are usually held down in a combination with another key (see the specific application manual for details).  The SHIFT and ESC keys are also frequently used.
"Escape key - The ESC (Escape) key is used to abort an application. While in a dialog box, it is the same as"
choosing Cancel.
"MOUSE The mouse (Figure 1) is a small hand-held device that allows a user to interface with the computer. The mouse lets you move an on-screen cursor over the entire screen. The mouse has two buttons, the left and the right."
